# Analog-pH-meter

Stolen from <https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_PH> to fix the issue <https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_PH/issues/10>

Used as a simple testing of the pH probe.

To you know that pH, historically denotes "potential of hydrogen"?

This was done in [platformio](https://platformio.org/) in VSCode.
